	<p>
	Welcome to Find Fix, the web application that allows you to record, discuss and search for IT support problems and fixes. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	With Find Fix you can create a record of an IT support problem, saving details such as name, description and 
	error messages then share or discuss the record with others.  Any user can post a fix for a problem which 
	can be voted on (once per user) to make good solutions stand out.  To discuss problems or fixes you can post a comment that will appear below each post.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You can search for existing problems and fixes using the search bar.  Problems are organised into categories and can be 
	tagged with relevant keywords to make the search more effective.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You can browse or search for <%= link_to("existing problems", {:controller => 'posts', :action => 'list'}) %> at any time.  To post a problem, fix, comment or vote
	<%= link_to("login", {:controller => 'user_access', :action => 'login'}) %> or  <%= link_to("create an account", {:controller => 'users', :action => 'new'}) %> if 
	you do not already have one.  Happy Fixing! 
	</p>
