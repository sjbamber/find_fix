	<p>
	Welcome to Find Fix, the web application that allows you to record, discuss and search for IT support problems and fixes. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Find-fix.com is a collaboratively edited knowledge base for IT support and computer based problems. 
	Users can save details of their problem, then share or discuss the problem with others to arrive at a solution.	Problems and suggested fixes can be voted 
	on (up to once per user) to promote good fixes and make it easy for other users to decide if the fix is genuine.</p>
	<p>
	You can search for existing problems and fixes using the search bar.  Problems are organised into categories and can be 
	tagged with relevant keywords to make the search more effective. You can filter your search using these categories and tags to make finding the record you want easier.
	</p>
