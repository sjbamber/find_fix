<b>Ruby on Rails application - Find Fix</b>

Find Fix is a wiki style application that enables users to post 'problems' which in turn can have 'solutions' and 'comments' posted to this.  Existing posts can be searched using a full-text search

The live application is located here: http://find-fix.com


<b>Search</b> - 
The search facility uses the hosted search service 'Searchify IndexTank' (http://www.searchify.com/) and the 'Tanker' gem (https://github.com/kidpollo/) to interact with the IndexTank API.  The post model is indexed including the attributes title and description and nested attributes error messages, tags, categories, solutions and comments.  Query results matched with the index and are ranked using a scoring function to sort by relevance.  Returned results come with a snippet of text that highlights words found in the index.
